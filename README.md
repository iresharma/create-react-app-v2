# create-react-app-v2 ðŸš€
## This only wroks for Mac/Linux or an system with UNIX on it (WSL inclusive)

I did not like the kind of app the current version of [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev) npx package makes. Once it's done we need to refactor a lot of code and I don't prefer that.

### ME DEV ME AUTOMATE STUFF

with the same thinking I wrote this shell script which helps you setup a react app with router and all included.

#### This is an extension to create react app and not a replacement with uses cerate react app to first create an app and then modify it.

## How to use
Just give this script an execute permission, and run it (to keep thing simple just run the following command)

`chmod 777 createReactApp.sh`

### for long term use you add this script as an environment variable
